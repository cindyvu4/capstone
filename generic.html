								<h2>What is Autism?</h2>
								<p>	Autism, also known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disorder that impairs the ability to communicate and interact with others.  The term spectrum refers to a wide range of symptoms and diagnostics including autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and Asperger syndrome.  It also refers to a range of levels of disability in individualsâ€™ ways to think, learn, and problem-solve. Some children may be severely challenged while others can perform daily activities without substantial support (NiH, 2018). There has not been direct causation linked to ASD, but researchers have concluded that it is due to different contributing factors including environmental, biologic, and genetic. ASD occurs in all racial groups but is 4 times more likely in boys than in girls (CDC, 2019). </p>
